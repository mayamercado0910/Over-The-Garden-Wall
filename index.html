            <p>Beatrice is a Blue Bird that we later learn was once a human. She leads the boys to Adalaide so that she can “send them home” but it was really a trap, but Beatrice knew and was willing to sacrifice the boys to make her human again. She later changes her mind and helps the boys escape Adalaide and still becomes human again.</p>
